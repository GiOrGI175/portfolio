    "storyInfo": "TATTAK ART GALLERY was born from the vision and passion of Tata Kacharava, an avid art enthusiast with a lifelong love for creativity. Growing up surrounded by art, Tata found inspiration in the power of visual expression and its ability to tell stories and evoke emotions. After years of traveling, collecting unique pieces, and connecting with artists from all walks of life, the dream of opening a gallery became a reality. In 2022, Tata transformed an old, historic building in the heart of Tbilisi into TATTAK ART GALLERY. This space was created with the intention of providing a platform for both emerging and established artists, offering them a place to showcase their work and connect with a broader audience. The gallery is driven by a desire to create an inclusive environment where art is accessible to everyone, whether you're a seasoned collector or someone just beginning to explore the world of art. Today, TATTAK ART GALLERY stands as a testament to passion for art, creativity, and community. It continues to be a place where artists and art lovers alike can come together to celebrate the beauty and diversity of artistic expression.",
